## 📌 Overview

Road traffic accidents are a major global safety concern, and early detection is crucial for reducing emergency response time and minimizing casualties.  
This project introduces a **Hybrid CNN–Vision Transformer (CNN–ViT) architecture** that leverages:

- **EfficientNet** for local spatial feature extraction  
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for global contextual understanding  
- **Cross-attention fusion** to integrate CNN and Transformer representations  
- **Temporal attention** to capture motion dynamics in video streams  

The system is deployed using a **Streamlit web application** that supports **image, video, and live webcam inputs**, along with automated alert mechanisms.
